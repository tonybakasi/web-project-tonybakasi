# web-project-tonybakasi
This is a template website I have built for my campus ministry church on DMU, Believers Love World. Once my assignment is marked and handed back to me I will then edit
it appropriately to match the themes of my church. As part of the media team, it is vital we use online resources to help grow the church digitally to pull a
further out audience. I have included a sign up page, product page and scripture to accompany the homepage. The reason I have chosen this format is because;
A sign up page (accompanied with a back end) will allow us to get user data and send information on upcoming programs or daily biblical messages that will encourage
and promote new and polished christians. The Scripture page includes a brief overview of what Chrisitianity is and the values that Jesus set, for anyone who is unsure. 
This section also will include church leaders so users know who to refer to in the ministry. Finally, a products page will allow an exchange of goods and services to 
boost the church's finances to uphold and increase resources.
